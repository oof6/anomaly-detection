# Questions 

#### **Technical Challenges:** Describe the greatest challenge(s) you encountered in translating the template from CloudFormation to Terraform. (1-2 paragraphs)
- 


#### **Access Permissions:** What element (specify file and line #) grants the SNS subscription permission to send messages to your API? Locate and explain your answer.
- 



#### **Event flow and reliability:** Trace the path of a single CSV file from the moment it is uploaded to raw/ in S3 until the FastAPI app processes it. What happens if the EC2 instance is down or the /notify endpoint returns an error? How does SNS behave (e.g., retries, dead-letter behavior), and what would you change if this needed to be production-grade?
- 


#### **IAM and least privilege:** The IAM policy for the EC2 instance grants full access to one S3 bucket. List the specific S3 operations the application actually performs (e.g., GetObject, PutObject, ListBucket). Could you replace the “full access” policy with a minimal set of permissions that still allows the app to work? What would that policy look like?

#### **Architecture and scaling:** This solution uses batch-file events (S3 + SNS) to drive processing, with a rolling statistical baseline in memory and in S3. How would the design change if you needed to handle 100x more CSV files per hour, or if multiple EC2 instances were processing files from the same bucket? Address consistency of the shared baseline.json, concurrent processing, and any tradeoffs.
